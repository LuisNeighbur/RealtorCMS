						<p>Unfortunately, home selling has become a more complex business than it used to be. New seller disclosure statements, longer and more mysterious form agreements, and a range of environmental concerns have all emerged in the past decade.</p>
						<p>More importantly, the home-selling process has changed. Buyer brokerage -- where REALTORS&reg; represent homebuyers -- is now common nationwide and good buyer-brokers want the best for their clients.</p>

Surviving in today&#39;s real estate world requires experience and training in such fields as real estate marketing, financing, negotiation and closing.</p>
